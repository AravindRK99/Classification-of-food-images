# Classification-of-food-images
This is a Deep Learning project which uses Convolution Neural Networks to demonstrate multi-class classification. The model is built from scratch. There are five layers used in the model and work is ongoing to further generalize the model. The model achieved an accuracy of 84% in training and 82% in test.
