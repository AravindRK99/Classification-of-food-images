# Classification-of-food-images
This is a Deep Learning project which uses Convolution Neural Networks to demonstrate multi-class classification. The model is built from scratch. There are five layers used in the model and work is ongoing to further generalize the model. The model achieved an accuracy of 84% in training and 82% in test. The model was trained on a cloud GPU using Google Colab.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle from a dataset called Food 101. The dataset is a custom one made form scratch having 5 classes: Cupcakes, dumplings, pizza, fried rice and french fries. Each class has 1000 images with 800 in training and 200 in test.
